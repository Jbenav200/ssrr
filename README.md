# Scottish Space Rock Register

### This is our Integrated Project 3 solution
As a group we decided that we wanted to develop
a web based application which records and visualises

data from NASA's Meteorite API.


#### What Does the S.S.R.R do with the API data?
The Scottish Space Rock Register collects data about Landed Meteorites.
This data allows us to visualise areas on earth by co-ordinates
where meteorites have landed and display more information. 

#### Want more?
The S.S.R.R will have a record all of these Meteorites and offers 
a searchable register with more detailed information.

as well as filtering the data and viewing it on a map,
you can also request a copy of our current data to date.
In our docs pages you can see how to build an app to visualise
the data. Our data is currently available in CSV or JSON.

### SSRR Docs Section
Here is where you will find our step by step image led tutorial
on how to build a web application in Django which visualises the data
found in our dataset. You don't have to use the our data to do this, and
we will show you how you can use your own data.

The tutorial makes use of a number of libraries and an API,
if you're not familiar with using APIs or javascript libraries
we suggest following different tutorials.

Here are a few suggestions from us:
